# Install Guide: VRChat Creator Companion - User Package

[Main](../../) > [Install Guides](../) > VRChat Creator Companion - File

## Info

Most of my script require require [RiskyKen - Core](https://payhip.com/b/cg4tN). You must install this first. Any Creator Companion version (Repository or User Package). The Unity Package version will not work!

## Install

1. Read the above info or you are going to have a bad time. ^^
2. Extract the `VRC CC.zip` somewhere on your computer.
3. In Creator Companion click ***Settings > Packages > Scroll Down To User Packages > Click The + Symbol***.
4. Browse to the location the zip file was extracted and select the folder.
5. Now go back to Projects, select Manage Project and add the package from the list.
