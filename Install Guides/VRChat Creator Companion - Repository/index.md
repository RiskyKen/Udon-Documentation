# Install Guide: VRChat Creator Companion - Repository

[Main](../../) > [Install Guides](../) > VRChat Creator Companion - Repo

## Info

Most of my script require require [RiskyKen - Core](https://payhip.com/b/cg4tN). If installing a free package it is automatically included. When installing a paid package you must add the free package repo first so you have core. `https://plushie.moe/vpm/free/package.json` or [click here](vcc://vpm/addRepo?url=https%3A%2F%2Fplushie.moe%2Fvpm%2Ffree%2Fpackage.json) to automatically add it to the Creator Companion.

## Install

1. Read the above info or you are going to have a bad time. ^^
2. In Creator Companion click ***Settings > Packages > Add Repository***.
3. Paste in the VCC URL that comes with the package. Will be in the text file `VRC CC.html`
4. Press Add then I Understand.
5. Now go back to Projects, select Manage Project and add the package from the list.
